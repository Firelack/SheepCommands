# Sheeps commands

## 🐑 Project Summary

This project is a Google Apps Script designed to manage sheep orders for a private individual.

This code comes from a Google Sheet and Apps Script to track, organize, and process orders, automating tasks such as generating transport papers, summarizing pending requests, and clearing data tables. The main goal is to simplify the logistics of managing these personal orders.
